        <h1>My Favorite Story</h1>
        <p> Once upon a time, my brother learned lessons the hard way. When we were young, he must have been around 6 or 7 years old, and he had these flexible tubes as toys that had water and trinkets in them. One of them, was filled with glow in the dark fluid. and he not once, not twice, not even three times, but on several ocassions, would be playing with them while he would go to sleep, and somehow accidentally rip them open, to which glow juice would pour into his eyeballs. Numerous times my step-dad would march into his room at the sound of pain and screaming, and numerous imes my poor brother would have to spend a half hour or so flushing out his eyeballs of poisonous material. He has been since banned from using glow in the dark toys, and as far as I know this ban still holds.</p>
